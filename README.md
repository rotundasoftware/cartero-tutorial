> DEPRECIATION NOTICE: At long last, cartero has been depreciated. As the first multi-page application build tool, cartero served its purpose well for many years. However now there are far more robust and better supported tools that can be used to achieve the same goals. We recommend migrating any projects still using cartero to [Web Pack](https://webpack.js.org/). Thank you to everyone who contributed to this pioneering project.

# Example application

This repo is the example application built in [this cartero tutorial](http://www.jslifeandlove.org/intro-to-cartero/).
